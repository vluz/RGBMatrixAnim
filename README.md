# XIAO 6x10 RGB MATRIX Animations

I've compiled a set of 11 animations for the 6x10 RGB MATRIX from XIAO      
These come from documentation, adafruit examples, and bits and bobs      
from all over the net.

The code has been tested on a XIAO RP2350 but should work with other      
XIAO boards with minimal or no modifications.
